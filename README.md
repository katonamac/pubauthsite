# Building a publisher/author website

The purpose of this project is for me to practice a variety of web development skills. I want to start off just building a static website with basic HTML5 and CSS, which I mostly know how to do already. Eventually, I hope to have a more comprehensive, modern web design in place, possibly using Django since I'm also learning Python. I don't care if this site is the best thing ever.  It's good practice for everything from coding to content development.

Things that the website absolutely must have:
1. An explanation of the enterprise and its purpose/goals
2. Links to purchase all the books that are available, preferably affiliate links
3. Information about new releases
4. An e-mail signup so I can start developing a mailing list
5. An "about" page for the author (me)
6. A link to my Patreon which doubles as the blog/community

Things that would be nice to have eventually:
1. Blurbs from readers/reviewers
2. An in-house community (not kicking people over to Patreon)
3. Bonus material/teasers
4. Promotional art
5. More interactivity in general
6. A setup whereby someone who isn't me can manage the damn thing

The skills I hope to practice:
-HTML5
-CSS
-PHP
-Python
-Working from the command line
