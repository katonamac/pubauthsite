      <h2>About A. Kat</h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;m a professional nerd by day, and&hellip;all right, you caught me.  I&rsquo;m a nerd all the time.</p>
      <p>I started writing stories for fun as a little kid, and by the time I was a teenager I had settled on fantasy as my preferred genre.  Ever since then, my fiction has been a beloved passion project.  Throughout my academic career, I&rsquo;ve come back to writing fiction time and again, purely for my own enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Until now.</p>
      <p>After working on Inferno for over a decade, I decided to share it with the world instead of keeping it to myself and a few friends.  I wouldn&rsquo;t have done this prior to the rise of independent publishing as a viable alternative to the industry&rsquo;s traditional models.  While my background in the sciences has shown me the value of collaboration for many projects, I don&rsquo;t believe it is the best way to create a compelling narrative within an intricate fantasy world.  I think it better to stay true to a single, overarching vision to maintain the integrity of such a story, so that is the path I&rsquo;ve chosen.  There will be no creation by committee here.</p>
      <p>It is my sincere wish that this work will resonate with a discerning audience on a variety of different levels, but that is not within my control.  Once something is published, it has effectively been released &ldquo;into the wild&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s going to take on a life of its own.  Every creator has to make their peace with this truth.  I confess that at times, it can be intimidating, but I refuse to let it deter me.</p>
      <p>In the world of Inferno, the heroes are people who have the courage to think differently and question what they&rsquo;ve always been told.  By all means, enjoy the ride, but as you go I hope this tale prompts you to question or to doubt at least one thing you believe.  I&rsquo;ve certainly experienced that while writing it, so it&rsquo;s only fair.</p>
      <p>Stand tall and walk boldly forward, friend.</p>
